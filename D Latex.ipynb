    "[Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/about/) is a markup language to typeset documents. Specifically, Latex is really good at typesetting *math*. We are going to use Latex in our Markdown cells to render beautiful mathematical formulas. How we are going to use Latex only scratches the surface of what Latex can be used for (i.e. writing entire papers, as an alternative to Microsoft Word). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Math Mode\n",
    "To enter Latex code in a Markdown cell, we need to enter \"math mode\", which is prefacing our Latex code with the \\\\$ symbol for inline Latex, and \\$\\$ for block Latex. For example:\n",

    "The word pi in Latex, $pi$, looks more \"mathy\".\n",
